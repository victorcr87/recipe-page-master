        <ol>
          <li>
            Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven
            to 350°F (177°C).
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the crust: Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers
            into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar and melted
            butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the
            food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom
            and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No
            need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to
            pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the
            oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The
            foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow
            crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a
            paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar
            together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is
            smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla
            extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium
            speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until
            just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter,
            stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and
            cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare the simple water bath (see note) Boil a pot of water. You
            need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so
            make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As
            the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the
            springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use
            a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the
            pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water
            inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the
            roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water in.
            Whichever is easier for you.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set.
            When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if
            you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door
            slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it
            cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then
            cool cheesecake completely at room temperature. Then refrigerate the
            cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.
